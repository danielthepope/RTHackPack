# Hello!

We've put together some example data streams to get us up and running quickly on [Saturday](http://www.meetup.com/JSOxford/events/221085527/).

You can view them online at [jsoxford.com/RTHackPack/](http://jsoxford.com/RTHackPack/).

You're definitely not limited to the streams/tech covered by these demos - there's a [whole](http://faye.jcoglan.com/) [lot](http://peerjs.com/) [of](https://rtc.io/) [very](https://github.com/dominictarr/scuttlebutt) [cool](https://realtimehackernews.firebaseapp.com/) [stuff](https://github.com/benfoxall/tweets/) [out](https://instagram.com/developer/realtime/) [there](http://www.webrtc.org/); though this gives us a good place to start.

## Getting started with the demos

1. Download this project [here](https://github.com/jsoxford/RTHackPack/archive/gh-pages.zip)
2. Open an html file in the demo directory
3. Get hacking

## Things you could do

* set a background colour of `time.html` based on the timestamp and watch several devices tick together
* show which trains are pulling into Oxford
* plot geocoded tweets on a map
* speak out loud any tweets to JSOxford (hint: `speechSynthesis.speak(new SpeechSynthesisUtterance('Hello World'));`)

## Contributing demos

Feel free to add stuff,  the main target of this is to get something hackable with as little effort as possible.  We should be able to tweak demos with just a text editor and a web browser, so 1) allow it to be opened with `file://` and 2) make it as self contained as possible.
